# Midterm 3

# Write a function called numDotElements. Your function should take the following
# arguments
#   <chvec>: A character vector containing strings of letters, possibly 
#     with the "." symbol
#
# and return the following
#   <num.dot>: an integer indicating how many elements of <chvec> contain the "."
#     symbol. For example: numDotElements(c('USA', 'U.S.A', '...')) should return 2

numDotElements=function(string){
  x=grep(pattern=".",x=string)
  return(length(x))
}

teststring=c("USA","U.S.A")





# Write a function called sumDigits that compute the sum of all the digits in
# a string.  The function should return 0 if there is no digit in the
# string. Your function should take the following arguments:
#   <chvec>: A character vector of length 1 (chvec contains only 1 string)
#
# and return the following
#   <total>: A single number (the sum of all the digits in chvec)



# Some test cases:
all.equal(sumDigits("1z3p ! 21"), 7)
all.equal(sumDigits("abcdefg"), 0)



# Write a function called hisToHer that converts every instance of 
# him in a string to her; every instance of he to she and every instance 
# of his to her. You can assume everything is lower case. Be careful not 
# to replace words that contain him/he/his (eg you don't want to
# replace the with ther). Your function should take the argument
#   <chvec>: A character vector
#
# and return
#   <herchvec>: The same character vector with the required substitutions.


hisToHers=function(chvec){
  herchvec=strsplit(chvec," ")
  herchvec=gsub("\\bhim\\b","her",herchvec)
  herchvec=gsub("\\bhe\\b","she",herchvec)
  herchvec=gsub("\\bhis\\b","her",herchvec)
  herchvec=paste(herchvec,sep="")
  return(herchvec)
}


# A test case
  hisToHers("he went to the store his mother gave him")
  hisToHers("she went to the store her mother gave her")







#Write a function called mostCommonLetter that finds the most common 
# letter in a string. If there is a tie for most common letter return 
# all of the letters that were most common. Your function should 
# convert all letters in the string to *lower case* and you should 
# remove  everything other than letters. 
# Your function has the argument
#  <chvec>: A character vector of length 1 (chvec contains only 1 string)
#
# and it should return
#  <letter> The most common letter or letters in the string.
# For example mostCommonLetter("aabbccccdddd") should return 
# [1] "c" "d"


mostCommonLetter=function(string){
  string=tolower(gsub("[[:digit:]]","",string))
  string=string[string!=""]
  tab=table(unique(strsplit(string,"")))
  return(which(tab==max(tab)))
}
